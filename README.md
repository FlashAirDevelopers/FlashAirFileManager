## Build

### Windows

- Install node.js(6.x)
- `npm install -g --production windows-build-tools`
   - Run it at the command prompt 'Run as administrator' or on Windows PowerShell.
   - Administrator authority is unnecessary for the following procedures.
- `npm install -g yarn`
- `git clone https://github.com/FlashAirDevelopers/FlashAirFileManager`
- `cd FlashAirFileManager`
- `yarn install`

## Troubleshooting

- Failed to build keytar.
   - The behavior of [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp) used for build requires installation of Python 2.x series. Please make sure that is installed or Path is passed.
   - For Windows, Python 2. series should be installed along with the installation of [Windows-Build-Tools](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows-build-tools).
   - It may be solved by executing the following command.
      - `cd FlashAirFileManager`
      - `cd node_modules/keytar`
      - run `..\.bin\node-gyp rebuild --target=1.7.8 --arch=x64 --dist-url=https://atom.io/download/atom-shell`
      - Please specify the version number of Electron for `- target` and the parameter of your environment for `--arch = x64`.
